
# FINAL PROJECT

I wanted to explore and experiment with styleGAN a little more for the final
So I went on and used styleGAN to generate porcelains

The project aims to bring more from the "past" to the "modern"
Recreating the classics using a contemporary technique(machine learning)
The generated porcelains will become key elements to create further products/architecture/furnitures/etc
