# POEM VERSION .02

### Overview

* 🎲 I chose to work with a poem by Bei Dao(北岛)
* 📜 The poem is titled as "*All*"("一切")
* 🀄️ Originally scripted in Chinese, translated in English

### Process
- I experimented with three different versions
- Each version is formated relating to the content of the poem
\n
##### THE FIRST EXPERIMENT
- This focuses on displaying both Chinese and English version of the poem
- I imported tabulate to format a table

##### THE SECOND EXPERIMENT
- For instance, putting them next to each other in a table
- It is always interesting to see how could a different language change the mood and atmosphere of a poem a little bit
- even though they translated to be exact same words

##### THE THIRD EXPERIMENT
- For instance, putting them next to each other in a table
