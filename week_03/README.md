
# POEM VERSION .03


### Overview

* 🎲 I chose to work with a poem by Bei Dao(北岛)
* 📜 The poem is titled as "*All*"("一切")
* 🀄️ Originally scripted in Chinese, translated in English

### Process
- I experimented with different formats
- Trying to relate the visual to the content of the poem
- Compare to last week, I try to add more designs to each variation.
- There is one more variation added at the end, which is formated in a vertical single column, like traditional Chinese script.
