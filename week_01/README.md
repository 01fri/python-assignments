# Poem Version .01
### Jun 14, Monday

* 🎲 I chose to work with a poem by Bei Dao
* 📜 The poem is titled as "*All*"
* 🀄️ Originally scripted in Chinese
- With the first version of the poem, the format is simple and straightforward
- After created both English and Chinese version of the poem
- I started to explore how to put both version together
- For instance, putting them next to each other in a table
