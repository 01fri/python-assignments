# POEM VERSION .02

<br/>

### Overview

* 🎲 I chose to work with a poem by Bei Dao(北岛)
* 📜 The poem is titled as "*All*"("一切")
* 🀄️ Originally scripted in Chinese, translated in English

<br/>
<br/>

### Process
- I experimented with three different variations
- Each version is formated relating to the content of the poem

<br/>
<br/>

##### THE FIRST EXPERIMENT

- This version focuses on displaying both Chinese and English version of the poem
- Make it easy to refer or compare
- I imported tabulate to format a table
- Compare to last week, I cleaned up the codes
- And formated the code so that it's easier to read and modify

<br/>
<br/>

##### THE SECOND EXPERIMENT

- Then I started to format the poem in a way that relate to the content
- I picked up the word 'repetition' in the poem
- And used a for loop to create a real repetition of the line

<br/>
<br/>

##### THE THIRD EXPERIMENT

- The other word I picked up is from the Chinese version
- which is "回声"(means 'echo') in the last line of the poem
- So I used another for loop to create a visual echo using the characters
