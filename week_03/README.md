### Process
- I experimented with different formats, trying to relate to the content of the poem
- Connect the visual with the content
- Compare to last week, I try to add more designs to each variation.
- For instance, the first experienment(the table) is given with a slight different design; 
- there is one more variation at the end, which comes with vertical single column script, like traditional Chinese script.
